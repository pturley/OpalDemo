Opal: Yet another precious gem

With me, Patrick Turley














What's the deal with all of the Gemstones

- Topaz
- Amethyst
- Emerald
- Ruby

If you want to create a new programming language call it Aquamarine!

So...we can look at Opal..I guess

What is Opal?

- Ruby to Javascript compiler
- Has integrations with:
-- The asset pipeline
-- JQuery (even if they arent that great)
-- Rspec
-- Haml
-- And others

Yo, what about Coffeescript?  I heard that is cool too. What makes Opal better than Coffeescript?
