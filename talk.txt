Opal: Yet another precious gem

With me, Patrick Turley














What's the deal with all of the Gemstones

- Topaz
- Amethyst
- Emerald
- Ruby

If you want to create a new programming language call it Aquamarine!

How many languages compile to javascript?

So...we can look at Opal..I guess

What is Opal?

- Ruby to Javascript compiler
- Has integrations with:
-- The asset pipeline
-- JQuery (even if they arent that great)
-- Rspec
-- Haml
-- And others

Yo, what about Coffeescript?  I heard that is cool too. What makes Opal better than Coffeescript?


My lesson was that Coffeescript is significantly more fully featured, but Opal can talk directly to Ruby objects so why not use both.
